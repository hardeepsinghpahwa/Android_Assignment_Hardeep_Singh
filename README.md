Hi

This the android asssignment submitted by Hardeep Singh Pahwa

- Use latest android studio to run this project.
- This project loads images from url without using any third party library.
- MVVM architecture is used for the project.
- Data binding is enabled for better experience.
- Kotlin Courotines are used by async tasks.
- Images once loaded are stored in memory cache and also in disk cache.
- Upon reloading if the image is found in memory cache it loads from there or it jumps to finding in disk cache.
- An extra article with empty data is also added at last to showcase error handling or image loading.

There are no specific instructions to run this project. When you open the project the main screen opens with the grid view of images.

Thanks.
